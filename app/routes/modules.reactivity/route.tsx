        <p>
          Effect Atom caches query results. Reactivity keys let you describe the domain surfaces
          behind those caches so targeted invalidation happens automatically. Use this module to
          practice pairing a tagged query with a mutation that calls out the same keys.

          <li>
            Name the data surfaces that must stay fresh and decide on a key scheme (e.g.&nbsp;
            <code>"dashboard:active-tickets"</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Decide which mutations change each surface and map them to the corresponding key list.

          <li>
            Only after you have a hypothesis should you inspect the reference implementation and
            verify that the runtime refreshes exactly what you expected.

        <h3>Reference implementation</h3>

          The interactive example renders two dashboard cards. The first card reads a query tagged
          with
          <code>Atom.withReactivity</code>. The second card is a cached view with no matching key.
          Run the mutation to see how the keyed card updates while the unrelated one stays
          untouched.

          Compare your draft with the code. Did you choose a similar key scheme? Did you account for
          the unaffected card remaining stable? Note any mismatches&mdash;they are the concepts you
          should reinforce.

          Relate this module to earlier lessons. How would a counter, derived state, or stream
          benefit from tagging queries with reactivity keys? Say the connections aloud so the
          relationship sticks when you revisit the concept later.

          <li>
            Same day: rebuild the tagged query and mutation from memory, confirming that only the
            keyed card re-renders.
          </li>
          <li>
            In three days: add a second key (e.g.&nbsp;
            <code>"dashboard:stale-count"</code>) to a real cache in your codebase and retire a
            manual reset.
          </li>
          <li>
            One week later: apply this pattern in combination with the HTTP or streams module so
            derived data refreshes alongside remote updates.
