          Your brain will retain more if it struggles first. Before reading the solution panels,
          tackle the warm-up scenario and commit your assumptions about sequencing, error handling,
          and UI states to paper.

        <h3>Warm-up challenge</h3>
        <p>
          You need an atom that kicks off an asynchronous job, exposes Result-based states to React,
          and composes a secondary atom once the first settles. Without peeking below, outline how
          you would stage that workflow.

            Draft a minimal Effect atom that reports loading, success, and failure. Mark where the
            Result transitions live in your UI.

        <h3>Reference implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Walk through the canonical implementation and annotate the differences. Pay attention to
          where the runtime guarantees ordering, how errors propagate, and why React never touches a
          raw promise.

          Annotate the contrast between this solution and your draft. Did you try to juggle promises
          manually? Did you account for how
          <code>Result</code> keeps failure data structured? Capture those reflections because they
          are the hooks your memory will use later.

        <h3>Interleaving reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Connect this lesson back to the counter and derived-state modules. How would you combine
          deterministic counters with async Result streams? Forecast where these patterns will
          reappear (HTTP fetching, RPC mutations, streams) so retrieval feels natural when you
          encounter them again.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Why does wrapping asynchronous logic in <code>Atom.make</code> simplify React components
            compared to raw promises?
          </li>
          <li>
            How does <code>Atom.Context</code> ensure dependent workflows stay in sync, and what
            surprised you during the warm-up?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which part of your original hypothesis changed after comparing it to the guided
            solution, and why?

            Same day: rebuild the baseline atom without peeking. Add logging to confirm the Result
            transitions you expect.
          </li>
          <li>
            In three days: create a contextual Effect atom that fans out to two dependencies and
            reconciles their Results before returning.
          </li>
          <li>
            One week later: wire this pattern into the HTTP module. Wrap a fetch call, propagate
            failures via <code>Result</code>, and note how React stays declarative.
