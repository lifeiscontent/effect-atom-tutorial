          RPC integration: predict the contract before you see the code
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before examining the implementation, design how you would declare RPC contracts, set up an
          in-memory protocol, and bridge it into atoms. The anticipation makes the final walkthrough
          far more memorable. While sketching, annotate which pieces should live on the server
          boundary versus the browser client. The demo keeps them co-located for inspection, whereas
          production code hosts the protocol outside the UI bundle.
        </p>
        <ol className="module-intro__steps">
          <li>
            Draft the RPC contract: what queries and mutations exist, and what do their
            payloads/results look like?
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan how <code>AtomRpc.Tag</code> should expose typed atoms for queries and mutations,
            including reactivity keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decide how the UI will render loading, success, and failure states using{" "}
            <code>Result</code>. Write it down before you peek at the code.

          Compare your sketch to the canonical implementation. Focus on how RPC schemas translate
          into typed atoms, how reactivity keys keep data fresh, and how
          <code>Result</code> drives rendering.

          pattern in production.

          Highlight where reality matched your expectations and where it diverged. Those annotated
