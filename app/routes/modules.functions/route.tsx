        <p>
          Callable atoms often become command surfaces for your application. Before diving into the
          implementation, attempt the warm-up so you can confront the trade-offs yourself, especially
          around where status, errors, and dependencies should live.

        <p>
          Without peeking at the panels below, outline how you would build a callable atom that (a)
          logs values and (b) triggers a mutation that reports progress back to React. Capture
          answers to these prompts:

          Connect callable atoms back to the counter and effects lessons. How might you pair a

            Why would you prefer <code>Atom.fn</code> over custom hooks or context providers for

            How does writing to companion atoms keep React decoupled from Effect runtime details?

            Same day: rebuild both callable atoms from scratch. Add a third that performs validation
            before logging.
          </li>
          <li>
            In three days: refactor a production command to use <code>Atom.fn</code>, writing status
            updates into companion atoms so UI components stay declarative.
          </li>
          <li>
            One week later: pair callable atoms with the RPC module, routing mutations through a
            shared runtime and comparing the outcome to your notes.
