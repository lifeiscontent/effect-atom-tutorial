          Resist the temptation to jump straight to the working example. Sketch how a continuous
          ticker and a pull-driven paginator would behave, then use that draft to interrogate the
          implementation below.

            Outline how a continuous stream should pause when unsubscribed and resume when listeners

            Design a pull-based stream that accumulates items and exposes a loading indicator
            between pulls.

        <p>
          Connect streaming atoms to earlier lessons. How does the counter module help you reason
          about ticker updates? Where might derived atoms consume streaming data? Saying the links
          out loud strengthens the retrieval path.

          Write a short reflection in your learning journal or team knowledge base. Consider: What
          guarantees do Effect streams provide? How does
          <code>Result.match</code> keep rendering declarative? Which part of your warm-up draft
          changed after examining the solution?

            Same day: rebuild the ticker and pull-stream atoms from scratch, verifying your
            understanding of pauses and resumes.

          <li>
            In three days: refactor an existing polling feature to use Effect streams, noting the
            differences in behaviour and complexity.

          <li>
            One week later: combine this streaming pattern with the HTTP module to batch remote
            requests on demand, documenting the flow in your journal.
