          Pause here and design how you would inject a typed service into atoms. The time you spend

            Draft how <code>Atom.runtime</code> should supply that service to every atom built from

          Highlight where your plan matched the code and where it diverged. Did you account for
          swapping layers? Did you remember to render failure states with <code>Result.match</code>?
          Record these insights so they become quick wins when you revisit the topic.

          <li>
            In three days: refactor an existing feature to use <code>Atom.runtime</code> with
            layered services, documenting how the swap impacts tests or mocks.

          <li>
            One week later: extend this pattern to a network-backed service, logging how quickly you
            can swap between live and mock layers.
