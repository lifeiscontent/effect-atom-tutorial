          Atom families keep local registries coherent across keys
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine your app ships with a library of operational playbooks stored locally or behind a
          feature flag. Before diving into the reference, jot down how you would use{" "}
          <code>Atom.family</code>
          to hand those playbooks to any screen that supplies an id.
        </p>
        <ol className="module-intro__steps">
          <li>Sketch a service that hands out read-only playbooks from a shared registry.</li>
          <li>
            Decide how <code>Atom.family</code> should memoise atoms so repeated ids reuse cached
            reads.

        <h3>Why this family stays node-local</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine <code>Atom.family</code> wrapping static or rarely changing reference data such as
          brand palettes, operational procedures, consent copy, or onboarding checklists. Members are
          keyed, deterministic, and fetched from local registries or configuration layers instead of
          the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because families keep results in memory for the lifetime of the process (and offer no
          built-in eviction), they are a poor match for fast-changing feeds or per-request cache
          busting. Reach for derived atoms, subscription refs, or explicit loaders when freshness is
          critical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decide whether to wrap the family in <code>Atom.keepAlive</code> based on ownership:

        <ul className="module-emoji-guide">

            <span role="img" aria-label="open book">
              ðŸ“–
            </span>{" "}
            Shared UI chrome wants instant access to static copy? Keep the family alive so every tab
            renders synchronously.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
              âœ¨
            </span>{" "}
            Feature-specific components only touch a few ids? Let family members dispose normally so
            you avoid keeping unused atoms around.

          Compare your notes with the finished example. Look for how the runtime layers the playbook
          service, how <code>Atom.family</code> returns a canonical atom per id, and how{" "}
          <code>Result.match</code>
          presents loading, error, and success states.

        <p>
          Use the interactive controls to rotate the roster, toggle a duplicate id, or reset the
          list. Watch your browser console: only the keys that actually need data will call the{" "}
          <code>Playbooks.load</code> service, confirming your predictions from the warm-up prompts.
