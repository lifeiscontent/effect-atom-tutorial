        <p>
          Before you peek at the implementation, sketch how you would hydrate, persist, and validate
          state with <code>Atom.kvs</code>. The more concrete your draft, the easier it will be to
          encode the real solution into memory.

            Outline the runtime wiring: which layer provides access to localStorage and how do atoms
            share it?

            Decide which schemas you will apply to booleans, strings, and numbers, and where default

          Tie persistence back to previous modules. How does the counter example influence your
          approach here? How will derived atoms or effectful workflows benefit from persisted state?
          Saying these connections aloud cements the mental model.

          Write a short reflection in your own notes (journal, knowledge base, team wiki). Consider:
          What guarantees do schemas give you? How does <code>Atom.kvs</code> simplify React
          components? Which part of your warm-up draft changed after the comparison?
