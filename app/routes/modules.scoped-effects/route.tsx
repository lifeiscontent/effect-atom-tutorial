        <p>
          Before inspecting the implementation, outline how you expect scoped atoms to start,
          settle, and tear down resources. The friction you feel while sketching will make the real
          flow unforgettable.
        </p>
        <ol className="module-intro__steps">
          <li>
            Write down how a scoped atom should acquire a resource, expose loading/success/failure,
            and release it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decide where <code>Effect.addFinalizer</code> belongs and how React should learn about
            lifecycle changes.

            Only after drafting your plan should you inspect the panels below. Note every mismatch
            between your idea and the running example.

          Connect scoped atoms to previous modules. How does the counter example help you reason

          resources? Speak the connections aloud to reinforce them.

            In three days: refactor a real component to manage subscriptions or timers via a scoped
            atom, documenting what manual cleanup you eliminated.

          <li>
            One week later: combine scoped atoms with streaming or HTTP modules, noting how
            lifecycle control simplifies resource management.
