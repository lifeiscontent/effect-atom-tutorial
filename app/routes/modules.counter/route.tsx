            The atom stores the count and stays warm thanks to <code>Atom.keepAlive</code>. To
            witness it, navigate to another module and then return here; the counter should retain
            its value, confirming the keep-alive contract. Reading the value happens through{" "}
            <code>useAtomValue</code>; updates flow through <code>useAtomSet</code>, which always
            supplies the latest state. Because Effect serialises updates, you avoid stale closures
            without extra guards.

            Compare this flow with your attempt. Where did you converge? Where did you diverge?
            Capture the mismatches because those are the concepts that will stick once you reconcile
            them.

            As you move on to derived state, keep this mental model handy. The counter atom will
            become the upstream signal for transformations in the upcoming module, so articulate how
            setters and subscribers worked here before you interleave the next exercise.
