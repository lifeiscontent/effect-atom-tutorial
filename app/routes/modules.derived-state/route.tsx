        <h3>Warm-up challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Starting from your counter atom (reuse the previous lesson), design one derivation that
          needs full context access and another that survives as a pure projection. Keep your
          initial attempt private for now because you will compare it to the reference shortly.

        <h3>Reference implementation</h3>
        <p>
          The contextual derivation uses <code>{"Atom.make((get) => ...)"}</code> so it can
          orchestrate multiple dependencies, branch, or memoise work. The pure projection remains a
          simple <code>{"Atom.map(...)"}</code>. Compare each decision with your notes and highlight
          mismatches because they reveal what to reinforce.

          Annotate the contrast between this solution and your draft. Did you try to recompute
          everything manually? Did you remember that <code>Atom.map</code> keeps cached projections?
          Capture those reflections because they are the hooks your memory will use later.

          Say aloud how the counter module feeds this lesson. Forecast where these derivations will
          plug into async workflows or stream atoms next. Making those links now keeps the concept
          ready when it resurfaces.
